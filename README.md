Add a data folder that contains diff_files, grid_files, path_files, pgm_files, world_files, and yaml_files folders.


Running generator.py should get a test dataset of 20 worlds, showing the metrics for each. Change param_counter to 100 in generator.py, change showMetrics default value to 0 on line 587 of gen_world_ca.py, and comment out lines 708-717 in gen_world_ca.py to generate actual dataset.
